# Simple Shop Android

Simple Shop is an iOS application built with Swift that provides users with an interface to view and purchase products from an online store. The application uses several technologies and design patterns to implement its functionality

## Networking

The application fetches product data from an API using the URLSession framework. The data is then parsed into a Swift struct using the Codable protocol. The application uses the Result type to handle success and error cases when fetching data from the server.


## Testing

The application includes unit tests for the networking layer and model layer using the XCTest framework. The tests simulate network requests and parsing of JSON data to ensure that the application behaves as expected under different conditions.
